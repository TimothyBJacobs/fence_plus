#Fence Plus

Fence Plus is a WordPress plugin that creates an interactive dashboard for fencing coaches, and their students, powered by the askFRED API.

##Installation
Upload the zip file in the WordPress Plugins Administration Screen, and then click activate.


##Geting Started
###API Key
Fence Plus requires an askFRED API key. You can request one from [askFRED.net](https://sites.google.com/a/countersix.com/fred-rest-api/documentation/developer-access).

Once you have been issued an API key, head on over to the Fence Plus Options page, and save your API key.

###Importing Your Fencers
To import fencers into your installation go to the Fence Plus Importer, which is under the Fence Plus menu in your admin dashboard.

1. USFA ID. Here you need to enter the USFA ID of a fencer who has listed your club at their primary club on askFRED.
2. Delete all fencers. If you check this box, all of the fencer's in your installation will be deleted. This action is not reversible. Additionally, any fencers added to a coach will be removed.
3. CSV. Use this to import any additional fencers, as well as to import email addresses associated with your fencers. The CSV should be in the format of USFA ID, email address. Only fencers who have an askFRED account will be imported.

###Updates
Be default Fence Plus will update all fencer records every 24 hours. You can make this more or less frequent by visting the Fence Plus Options page.
